## 🛒 Groceloa – Digital Credit & Advance Ledger for Small Shops

**Groceloa** is a simple full-stack web application designed to help small grocery shopkeepers digitally manage **customer credit (loan)** and **advance (prepaid) balances**, replacing error-prone manual notebook tracking.

The system allows shopkeepers to record customer transactions with minimal effort, automatically calculate outstanding balances, and clearly distinguish between **advance usage** and **credit dues**, making daily operations faster and more reliable than paper-based methods.

### 🔑 Key Highlights

* Supports both **advance payments** (prepaid balance) and **credit transactions** (pay later) with clear separation of logic
* Automatically calculates customer balances, reducing manual errors and confusion
* Designed with a **simple, low-effort UI** suitable for non-technical and rural users
* Built using **Java Spring Boot**, **MySQL**, and **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** with clean, industry-standard architecture

### 🎯 Purpose

This project focuses on **real-world problem solving**, emphasizing simplicity, correctness, and usability over unnecessary features, while demonstrating strong full-stack development and backend business-logic design.
